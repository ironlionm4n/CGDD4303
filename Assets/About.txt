SLAB, made during 2019 Fall Semester at KSU
Programming by Kylie Gilde, CGDD major

Each script has its name and general purpose at the top.
Methods all have summaries as well.
I think I've done a thorough job commenting everything,
but if there's something you don't understand feel free
to contact me with questions.

A summary of all the scripts I wrote:
BUILDING
	-BuildSystem: Placement and building of previews, and deletion of built objects
	-BuiltObject: Resizing and deletion of prefabs
	-HideExamples: Hides and changes materials of example objects based on layer
	-LayerSelection: Switches the active layer of materials that can be seen and placed
	-PositionMesh: Centers mesh relative to their parent
	-Preview: Shows the player what and where they will be building, including snapping to set points
	-SnapPoint: A transform that previews will attach to when close
DISPLAY
	-CameraControl: Handles the camera's rotation and zoom
	-InputFieldVariableSet: Sets text for an empty input field
	-PositiveInputField: An input field that doesn't allow the '-' key
